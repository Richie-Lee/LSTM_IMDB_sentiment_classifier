# LSTM_IMDB_sentiment_classifier

This repository contains a simple **LSTM** (deep learning) implementation which executes a **sentiment classification** for IMDb reviews.
The model was built in roughly 1 week, from scratch, with **PyTorch**. 

The project was part of a master-level elective "deep learning" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which is why I decided to share the assignment as well for completeness.
