# LSTM_IMDB_sentiment_classifier

This repository contains a simple **LSTM** (deep learning) implementation which executes a **sentiment classification** (positive/negative experience) for IMDb reviews.
Additionally, I've also included a regular feed-forward network and Elman model to benchmark its performance.

The models were built in roughly 1 week, from scratch, with **PyTorch**, and achieved performance of roughly 85% accuracy, with minimal tuning and training epochs (due to computing power restrictions).

The project was part of a master-level elective "deep learning" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which is why I decided to share my written report as well.
